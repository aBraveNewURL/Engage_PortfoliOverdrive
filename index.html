            <p>Now, this is a story all about how
                my life got flipped-turned upside down.
                And I'd like to take a minute
                just sit right there
                I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air.
                In West Philadelphia born and raised
                on the playground was where I spent most of my days.
                Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool
                and all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school,
                when a couple of guys who were up to no good
                started making trouble in my neighborhood.
                <br>
                I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
                she said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air".
                I begged and pleaded with her day after day
                but she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way.
                She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
                I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it".
                First class, yo this is bad
                drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
                "Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?"
                Hmm, this might be alright.
                But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that,
                is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
                I don't think so.
                I'll see when I get there.
                <br>
                I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air.
                Well, the plane landed and when I came out
                there was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
                I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here.
                I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared
                I whistled for a cab and when it came near
                the license plate said, "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror,
                if anything I could say that this cab was rare.
                But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air"
                I pulled up to the house about seven or eight
                and I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo holmes, smell ya later".
                I looked at my kingdom
                I was finally there
                To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air.
