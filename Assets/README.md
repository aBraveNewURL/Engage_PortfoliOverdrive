For our second challenge we were asked to start from scratch and create the beginnings of our personal
portfolio- a long-term work in progress to showcase our accomplishments and bona fides.

Created both HTML and CSS wholecloth. 

Created placeholder for professionally-developed résumé ("Resume.md").

Used personal photos as background and placeholders for more fine-tuned and appropriate images later on.
